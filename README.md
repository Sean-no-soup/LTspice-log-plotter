you only need the python file I left some stuff for context, 

made this for an intro to electronics lab where I went on several tangents and ended up trying to find out what capacitors I should use with the secondary of a broken transformer to make a pi filter only to realize it wasn't easy to just run a handful of simulations and look at the output then more rabbit holes of .meas and plotting and here we are..... I may have gotten sidetracked
